dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libx11-dev libxft-dev libxinerama-dev libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev
```

Installation
------------
Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running dwm
-----------
Add the dwm as `.desktop` format.

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
